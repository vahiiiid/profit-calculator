fyne package -os darwin -icon icon.png

# For Linux
fyne package -os linux -icon icon.png

# Manual cross-compilation
# For Windows
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o profit-calculator.exe app.go

# For macOS (Intel)
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o profit-calculator-macos app.go

# For macOS (Apple Silicon)
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o profit-calculator-macos-arm64 app.go

# For Linux
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o profit-calculator-linux app.go
```

### Development Setup

1. **Install Fyne command-line tools:**
   ```bash
   go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne@latest
   ```

2. **Run in development mode:**
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

3. **Test the build:**
   ```bash
   go build -o profit-calculator .
   ```

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all calculation logic to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Running Tests

**Run all tests:**
```bash
go test
```

**Run tests with verbose output:**
```bash
go test -v
```

**Run tests with coverage:**
```bash
go test -cover
```

**Run benchmark tests:**

go test -bench=.
```

**Generate detailed coverage report:**
```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- **Calculation Logic**: Comprehensive tests for profit calculations including:
  - Basic profit calculations with various tax rates
  - Edge cases (zero revenue, zero expenses, losses)
  - Boundary conditions (maximum values, negative values)
  - Different tax rate scenarios (0%, 50%, 100%+)

- **Currency Formatting**: Tests for the euro formatting function including:

### Test Structure

```
profit-calculator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculations.go      # Core calculation functions (testable)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculations_test.go # Comprehensive test suite
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.go              # GUI application (uses calculation functions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod              # Go module definition
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.sum              # Go module checksums
```

The calculation logic has been extracted into separate, testable functions:
- `CalculateProfit()`: Main profit calculation logic
- `FormatEuro()`: Currency formatting with comma separators
- `FormatResult()`: Complete result formatting

### Example Test Cases

The tests include scenarios such as:
- **Basic calculation**: ‚Ç¨100,000 revenue, ‚Ç¨50,000 expenses, 19.5% tax ‚Üí ‚Ç¨40,250 profit
- **Zero tax**: ‚Ç¨10,000 revenue, ‚Ç¨6,000 expenses, 0% tax ‚Üí ‚Ç¨4,000 profit  
- **Loss scenario**: ‚Ç¨5,000 revenue, ‚Ç¨8,000 expenses, 20% tax ‚Üí ‚Ç¨2,400 loss (with tax benefit)
- **Edge cases**: Zero revenue, maximum values, 100% tax rate
